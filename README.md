# PROJECT AUTOMATION

Automation using Python and Selenium.

  #### Description:

In this project, I have developed a program to automate my day-to-day work activities of entering invoices into the company system. I have used the Selenium library to navigate and manipulate web pages.


 # Technologies used
  - Python
  - Selenium
  - SQL

  # Explaning the code:

The program starts by opening a CSV file that contains all the needed information and creating a SQL database from it.

The program starts by opening a CSV file that contains all the necessary information and creates an SQL database from it.

After that, the program opens the browser and goes to the login page to execute the login on the system.

Then, the code navigates to the invoice entry page and finds and clicks the "Add a new invoice" button.

On the "Add invoice" page, the program retrieves the invoice information from the database and inserts it into their respective input HTML tags.

Once all the information is inserted, the program clicks the save button and executes a function to check if the invoice was correctly saved.

Then, the program prints in the console whether the invoice was saved correctly and starts the process again with the next invoice.n the console if the invoice was saved correctly and starts the process again with the next invoice.

NOTES:
IT WAS REMOVED LINKS AND OTHER PRIVATE INFORMATION FROM THE UPLODED CODE!
THE CODE IS DEVELOPED FOR MY OPERATION ON A SPECIFIC WEBSITE SYSTEM, TRYING TO RUN IT WON'T WORK.
