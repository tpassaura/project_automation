# PROJECT AUTOMATION

Hello, my name is Tiago. I'm from Brazil and I live in the state of Paran√°. I'm an airplane pilot who is currently studying computer science and software development.

  #### Description:

In this project, I have developed a program to automate my day-to-day work activities of entering invoices into the company system. I have used the Selenium library to navigate and manipulate web pages.


 # Technologies used
  - Python
  - SQL

  # Explaning the code:

The program starts by opning a csv file that contains all the needed information and creating a SQL data base from it.

The program starts by opening a CSV file that contains all the necessary information and creates an SQL database from it.

After that, the program opens the browser and goes to the login page to execute the login on the system.

Then, the code navigates to the invoice entry page, finds and clicks the "Add a new invoice" button.

On the "Add invoice" page, the program retrieves the invoice information from the database and inserts it into their respective input HTML tags.

Once all the information is inserted, the program clicks the save button and executes a function to check if the invoice was correctly saved.

Then, the program prints in the console whether the invoice was saved correctly and starts the process again with the next invoice.n the console if the invoice was saved corretly and starts the procees again with the next invoice.

NOTES:
IT WAS REMOVED LINKS AND OTHER PRIVATE INFORMATION FROM THE UPLODED CODE!
THE CODE IS DEVELOPED FOR MY OPERATION ON A ESPECIFC WEBSITE SYSTEM, TRYING TO RUN IT WONT WORK.
